### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ My field of work: Applied Mathematics (Machine learning methods and theory) and Computational Sciences
- ðŸš€ I'm currently working on machine learning for differential equations, this includes two ongoing research  
      on deep neural networks utilizing orthogonal polynomials to numerically solve differential equations, and  
      methods depending on stochastic reformulation of PDEs.

    Some of the tinkering in this regard can be found at `tolgarecep/various`
- ðŸ¦¾ My previous work was TUBITAK granted research about Transformer-based Variational Autoencoders, which you can find at `tolgarecep/aggr-tfr-vae` and `tolgarecep/transformer-vae`
- ðŸ“« Reach me at tolgarecepucar (at) gmail (dot) com
- ðŸ’­ I'm also interested in film theory (with a disposition to French New Wave) and modernism (this new era  
      in history demans new forms of thinking)
